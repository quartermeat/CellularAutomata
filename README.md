# CellularAutomata
Attempting cellular automata with Windows Forms in C#

I'm using Waffle to manage this project.

Work and tickets will be accomplished within set monthly milestones.  If multiple developers come on board, I would like to create a develop branch for each developer.  I am managing branches and git with Sourcetree and GitFlow. I will merge each develop branch back into the master at the end of each milestone.
